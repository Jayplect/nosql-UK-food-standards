## Description
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. In this project, I evaluated some of their ratings data which might be useful to their journalists and food critics to decide where to focus future articles.

## Summary of Dataset

## Project Steps
### Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
Import the data provided in the `establishments.json` file from your Terminal. Name the database `uk_food` and the collection `establishments`.
 ! mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray path
 
 This field also includes non-numeric values such as 'Pass', where 'Pass' means that the establishment passed their inspection but isn't given a number rating. We will coerce non-numeric values to nulls during the database setup before converting ratings to integers.
