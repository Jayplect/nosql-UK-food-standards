## Overview
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. In this project, I evaluated some of their ratings data which might be useful to their journalists and food critics to decide where to focus future articles. One of the highlight of this porject is that I utilized the CRUD concept to create, view, modify and delete data from the database using PyMongo.

## Summary of Dataset

## Project Steps
### Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
Import the data provided in the `establishments.json` file from your Terminal. Name the database `uk_food` and the collection `establishments`.
 ! mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray path
 
 This field also includes non-numeric values such as 'Pass', where 'Pass' means that the establishment passed their inspection but isn't given a number rating. We will coerce non-numeric values to nulls during the database setup before converting ratings to integers.
