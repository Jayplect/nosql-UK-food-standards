## Overview
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. In this project, I evaluated some of their ratings data which might be useful to journalists and food critics to decide where to focus future articles. This project implements CRUD operations, which are commonly used in database systems and APIs to manage data. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, representing the basic operations performed on data. I utilized the CRUD concept to create, view, modify and delete data from the database with the help of PyMongo.

## Summary of Dataset

CRUD Operations
Create
To access the database I `Created` an instance of the Mongo Client using a default port of 27017. The server then processed the request and returned the resource. To confirm that the instance was returned, I used `mongo.list_database_names()` to list the representation of the created resource (in this case the databases).

Read
To retrieve a list of all resources, make a GET request to the /api/resource endpoint. The server will respond with a list of all available resources.

To retrieve a specific resource, make a GET request to the /api/resource/{id} endpoint, where {id} represents the unique identifier of the desired resource. The server will respond with the requested resource if it exists.

Update
To update an existing resource, make a PUT request to the /api/resource/{id} endpoint, where {id} represents the unique identifier of the resource to be updated. Include the updated data in the request body according to the API's specifications. The server will process the request and update the resource with the provided ID. The response may include a representation of the updated resource.

Delete
To delete a resource, make a DELETE request to the /api/resource/{id} endpoint, where {id} represents the unique identifier of the resource to be deleted. The server will process the request and delete the resource with the provided ID. The response may include a success message or a representation of the deleted resource.

Conclusion
This readme provided an overview of the CRUD operations implemented in this project. By utilizing the specified endpoints, you can create, read, update, and delete resources as per your requirements. Refer to the API documentation or further code exploration for detailed information about the request and response structures.



## Project Steps
### Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
Import the data provided in the `establishments.json` file from your Terminal. Name the database `uk_food` and the collection `establishments`.
 ! mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray path
 
 This field also includes non-numeric values such as 'Pass', where 'Pass' means that the establishment passed their inspection but isn't given a number rating. We will coerce non-numeric values to nulls during the database setup before converting ratings to integers.
